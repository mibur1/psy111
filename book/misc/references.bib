abstract = {This chapter discusses the fact that exploratory factor analysis (EFA) has several philosophical pitfalls that can make interpreting findings from the approach relatively subjective. It aims to distinguish between EFA and principal components analysis, and understand why they should not be likened to one another and are quite distinct statistical methods. Factor analysis focuses on the covariances and correlations among variables. In the factor model, the observed variable is theorized to be a function of latent variables. The key idea is to realize and understand that virtually all processes, variables, and otherwise 'things' are unknowable in this regard, and in this sense, are latent and not “observable” as they may at first glance appear. In EFA, commonality among variables is a priority, which means for most versions of factor analysis, the technique will typically not generate as many factors as there are variables subjected to it.}
