# W5 - General Linear Model (GLM)

In the previous statistics lecture, you were introduced to the General Linear Model (GLM), a flexible approach for modeling relationships between variables. Unlike traditional hypothesis testing, where you simply reject or accept the null hypothesis based on a predefined significance level, GLMs allow for a more interactive and nuanced analysis of data.

In today’s seminar, we will recap and explore the following key concepts:

1. **Multiple Linear Regression:** Extending simple linear regression to model the relationship between one dependent variable and multiple independent variables.
2. **Correlation:** Measuring the strength and direction of the relationship between two continuous variables.
3. **Partial Correlation:** Understanding the relationship between two variables while controlling for the influence of other variables.

After covering these concepts, you’ll have the opportunity to apply your new skills to a dataset related to diabetes and its risk factors.
