    "2. How would such a shape look in the real world? Print the array on the screen. Make sure you understand how the values displayed visually map onto the dimensions of the array.\n",
    "3. Can you generate such an array with only the `np.array()` method? *Hint: A three-diensional array can be seen as a list of lists of lists.*\n",
