# Setting things up

This book aims to be a standalone resource for the entire semester, providing supplementary materials for the lecture and acting as the main resource for the seminar. Each seminar session will start with a brief recap of the core concepts from the lecture and an introduction into the relevant Python tools. The second part will then let you apply the methods through hands-on exercises. These exercises can be used directly within the browser through [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/). However, the individual Jupyter Notebook files (`.ipynb`) can also be opened and run on your local computer.

As this will most definitely be useful for your future research, we will start with setting up a working Python environment on your own computer.
