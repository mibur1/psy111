    "Python has a small built-in namespace, which means there is only a limited amount of functions available by default. To access a wide range of functions and tools, we thus need to import additional modules and libraries. Please do the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Importing Entire Modules:\n",
    "    - Import the entire `math` module.\n",
    "    - Calculate and print the natural logarithm of 20.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Importing Specific Functions:\n",
    "    - Import only the `pow` function from the `math` module.\n",
    "    - Calculate and print 2 raised to the power of 3 ($2^3$).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Using Aliases for Modules:\n",
    "    - Import the `numpy` module using the alias `np`.\n",
    "    - Create a numpy array with the values [1, 4, 9, 16, 25].\n",
    "    - Calculate and print the square root of each element in the array using the numpy module.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Hint:* The numpy module is the fundamental Python package for scientific computing in Python. It uses arrays to store data. Please refer to the [documentation](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.array.html) for the third question. Do not worry about the details, we will discuss this package in more detail next week. "
