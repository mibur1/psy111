    "\n",
    "3. Using Aliases for Modules:\n",
    "    - Import the `numpy` module using the alias `np`.\n",
    "    - Create a numpy array with the values [1, 4, 9, 16, 25].\n",

Please refer to the [documentation](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.array.html) for the third question. Do not worry about the details, we will discuss this package in more detail later. "
